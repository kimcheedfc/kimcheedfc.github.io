We hope the best for Tanner in his future in Korea.

## Tanner

Hello Joseph,

Korea is a very amazing place. Many people and things to do here. It's also quite hot and humid.

The Korean lessons you provided have been incredibly helpful. I find it easy to communicate with the people here. Soon I will find another tutor to help further my Korean lessons.

I appreciate your help with contacting the DFC director here. I'm looking forward to meeting her whenever I can.

Blessings,

Tanner Betts
